{\bf {\Huge Honors Physics Fall Term \\ Recitation Problems}}

\bigskip
{\large Tips about this packet:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt 
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\rightarrow$}
\item Everyone should do every problem!
\item Put your work on the left-hand page. Use the right-right page for notes during presentations
\item Each person will present one problem to the class (approximately 10 minutes) near the end of the term
\item Choosing a problem that looks hard/scary/unfamiliar can allow you to become an expert in that, turning a weakness into a strength
\item The presentations will not be graded, but will be really helpful in preparing for the exam
\item Checking your solutions/answers with me before presentation day is a great idea (you'll only get 10 minutes to present in class, no matter what!)
\item There's no guarantee offered that this covers every piece of every standard from the term, but it's a great place to practice for the exam.
\end{itemize}}

{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} A police car is driving towards a parked pair of criminals eating Zagnuts after pulling off a heist. The police car is moving ${40~\tfrac{m}{s}}$ and is initially .4 km away from the criminals. The criminals are going to drive away from the police car in an attempt to escape.  Assume that the crimemobile moves with a constant acceleration of ${1.8~\tfrac{m}{s^2}}$. 

\bigskip
Where will the police catch them?

\vfill

Draw a velocity graph for the criminals.  Use it to determine how far down they road they are when the police car passes their starting point.

{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} A car 3.5 m in length and traveling at a constant speed of ${20~\tfrac{m}{s}}$ is approaching an intersection. The width of the intersection is 20 m. The light turns yellow when the front of the car is 50 m from the beginning of the intersection. If the driver steps on the brake, the car will slow at a rate of ${4.2~\tfrac{m}{s}}$ per second. If the driver instead steps on the gas pedal, the car will accelerate at ${1.5~\tfrac{m}{s^2}}$. The light will be yellow for 3 seconds. Ignore the reaction time of the driver. 

\bigskip
To avoid being in the intersection while the light is red, should the driver hit the brake pedal or the gas pedal? Justify your answer with some pretty physics.

{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} A wagon with two boxes of gold (total mass 300 kg) is cut loose from the horses by an outlaw when the wagon is at rest 50 m up a 6 degree slope. The outlaw plans to have the wagon roll down the slope and across the level ground, and then fall into a canyon where his confederates wait. 

\bigskip
Find the speed of the wagon when it reaches the flat ground. Note that it starts from rest at the top of the incline and that the wagon rolls with negligible friction.

\vfill

\vfill
If another bandit standing at the end of the slope requires twenty seconds to grab the gold, how far must the edge of the cliff be from the end of the slope, in order to make this double-heist successful?

{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} A 20 kg box rests on the flat floor of a truck. The coefficients of friction between the box and floor are ${\mu_s=.15}$ and ${\mu_k=.1}$. The truck stops gently at a stop sign and then starts to move with a constant acceleration. The box is 2.2 m from the rear of the truck when the truck starts.

\bigskip
What is the maximum possible acceleration that the truck may have if the box is not to slide?

\vfill
Suppose that the acceleration of the truck is instead ${2.1~\tfrac{m}{s^2}}$. How much time elapses before the box falls off the rear of the truck? 

\vfill
How far does the truck travel in this time?
