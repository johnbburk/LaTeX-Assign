	Show that this solution does, indeed, satisfy the integral form of

@QUESTION{1-3,
  problem = {Linear homogeneous PDEs with constant coefficients admit complex solutions
	of the form \[ u(x, \ t) = A e^{i(kx-\omega t)}, \] which are called
	{\em plane waves}. The real and imaginary parts of this
	
	complex solution give real solutions. Here $A$ is the amplitude, $k$
	is
	
	the wave number and $\omega$ is the temporal frequency. When the plane
	
	wave form is substituted into a PDE there results a {\em dispersion
	
	 relation} of the form $\omega = \omega(k)$ which states how the
	
	frequency depends on the wave number. For each of the following PDEs,
	
	find the dispersion relation and describe the resulting plane waves

	sketching (or use {\sc Maple}) wave profiles at different times.

@QUESTION{S1,
  problem = {Show that the series 
	
	\[ \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^k\, \tfrac{\log k}{k} \] 
	
	converges. Does it converge absolutely?},
  solution = {Let $\phi=\tfrac{\log x}{x}$. Since $\phi' = \tfrac{1 - \log x}{x}
	< 0 $ for $x>e$, the sequence $\{\tfrac{\log x}{x}\}$ is decreasing.
	Furthermore, L'H\^{o}pital's rule gives
	
	\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\log x }{x} = \lim_{x \rightarrow
	\infty} =\frac{1/x}{1} = 0. \]
	
	Therefore $ \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \tfrac{\log k }{k} = 0$ and
	so by the alternating series test, this series {\bf converges}.
	
	For $k \geq 3$, $\log k > 1$ and so 
	
	\[ \frac{\log k}{k} > \frac{1}{k}. \]
	
	Since the harmonic series $\sum \tfrac{1}{k}$ diverges, the series
	of absolute values will also diverge; that is the series is {\bf
	not absolutely convergent}.},

@QUESTION{S2,
  problem = {Is the series
	
	\[ \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{\sqrt{k+1} + \sqrt{k}} \]
	
	absolutely convergent, conditionally convergent or divergent?},
  solution = {Note that
	
	\[ \sqrt{k+2} + \sqrt{k+1} > \sqrt{k+1} + \sqrt{k} \]
	
	and so
	
	\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{k+2} + \sqrt{k+1}} < \frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1} + \sqrt{k}
	}.\]
	
	Therefore the sequence is decreasing. Furthmore
	
	\[ \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k+2} + \sqrt{k+1}}= 0.
	\]
	
	Thus, by the alternating series test, this series converges. However
	
	\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1} + \sqrt{k} } > \frac{2}{\sqrt{k}} \] 
	
	and so by the comparison test (with $\sum \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{k}}$) the
	series of absolute values diverges. Therefore the series is {\bf

@QUESTION{11-7,
  problem = {Find the Taylor series about $x=1$ for $\sin \pi x$. Express this
	series using the sigma notation.},
  solution = {Let $f(x) = \sin \pi x$ then
	
	\[ f'(x) = \pi \, \cos \pi x, \ f''(x) = {} - \pi^2 \, \sin \pi x,
	\ f'''(x) = {} - \pi^3 \, \cos \pi x, \ f^{(4)}(x) = \pi^4 \, \sin
	\pi x, \ \ldots .\]
	
	Now $\sin \pi = 0$ and $\cos \pi =-1$, therefore
	
	\[ f^{(2k)} (1) = 0 \text{ and } f^{(2k+1)} (1) = (-1)^{k+1} \, \pi^{2k+1}.

@QUESTION{2-1,

	= u_{tt}-c^2\,u_{xx} = 0. \] Solving $w_t+cw_x=0 $ by the method
	of characteristics, gives $w(x, \ t) = P(x-ct)$ for some arbitrary
	function $P$. Thus \[ u_t - c \, u_x = P(x-ct). \] The characteristic
	variables for this equation are $t=\tau$ and $x = \xi -c \tau$. In
	characteristic variables, the equation is \[ U_\tau = P(\xi-c\tau-c\tau)

	$G'=-\frac{P}{2c}$ (an arbitrary function!). Finally we obtain \[
