%{\bf {\Huge Honors Physics Recitation Problems}}

\bigskip
{\large Tips about this packet:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt 
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\rightarrow$}
\item These problems are designed as review for the term final. As we go through the term, you will be able to solve more and more of them.  Look at how much physics you're going to know! 
\item It's a great exercise to go through the packet periodically and identify places where models that you know apply and to identify specific situations that the models that you know don't apply.
\item Everyone should do every problem!
\item Put your work on the left-hand page. Use the right-right page for notes during presentations
\item Each person will present one problem to the class (approximately 10 minutes) near the end of the term
\item Choosing a problem that looks hard/scary/unfamiliar can allow you to become an expert in that, turning a weakness into a strength
\item The presentations will not be graded, but will be really helpful in preparing for the exam
\item Checking your solutions/answers with me before presentation day is a great idea (you'll only get 10 minutes to present in class, no matter what!)
\item There's no guarantee offered that this covers every piece of every standard from the term, but it's a great place to practice for the exam.
\end{itemize}}
