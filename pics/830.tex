{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} While sitting on a tree branch 9 meters above the ground (you're quite a climber!), you drop a chestnut.  When it's halfway to the ground, you throw a second chestnut downward.  \bigskipWhat initial speed do you need to give the second chestnut so that it strikes the ground at the same time as the first chestnut?\paragraph{}\noindent\vfill
