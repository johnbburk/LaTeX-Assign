{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}}A dune buggy takes off down the beach, driving ${8.9~\tfrac{m}{s}}$.  It then passes a second dune buggy, which sets off after it at a speed of ${12.1~\tfrac{m}{s}}$, after waiting four seconds to start.

\bigskipDescribe some ways in which a CVPM model of this situation would not match reality.

\vspace{30 mm}
How far has the first dune buggy traveled when it is caught by the second dune buggy?
