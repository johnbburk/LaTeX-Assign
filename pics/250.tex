{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} Two lightcycles (like from Tron - that movie was awesome, and the remake wasn't bad) charge at each other from an initial distance of 112 meters.  One lightcyle has a constant speed of ${25~\tfrac{m}{s}}$, and the other a constant speed of ${32~\tfrac{m}{s}}$. They drive at each other, barely missing a head-on collision.

\bigskipDoes CVPM apply? Why or why not?

\vspace{30mm}
How long after they begin driving will they pass each other?
