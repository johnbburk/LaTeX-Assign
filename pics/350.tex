{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} A car that is moving ${30~\tfrac{m}{s}}$ runs out of gas while driving up a hill.  The car comes to a stop 150 meters further up the hill than the point at which it ran out of gas.

\bigskip  How long, after running out of gas, did it take for the car to come to a stop?  Also describe, in words, the direction of the acceleration. Draw a kinematics diagram as part of your solution.
