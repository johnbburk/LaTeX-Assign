{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} A man, on the ground, throws a subway token to his friend on the platform above.  The token is thrown essentially straight up; it flies past the friend and falls back to him. Call the lower man’s hand ${y=0}$ and define “up” as positive.

\bigskip  Draw graphs of the token’s vertical position, velocity, and acceleration during the trip.  No numbers are necessary.Make sure that the time scales of the three graphs line up.

\bigskip Finally, show on both the position and velocity graphs the \emph sign (is it positive, negative, or zero?) of the average velocity for the trip.  Be sure that it’s clear which characteristic of each graph you used to determine the sign of the average velocity!
