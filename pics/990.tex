{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} The acceleration graph for a cart moving along a straight-line track is shown below.\bigskip
       Calculate the change in velocity over the first 3 seconds of motion.   \paragraph{}
\noindent
\vfill

Calculate the change in velocity over the entire 8 seconds of motion.    
\vfill

Given that the cart starts with an initial velocity of ${+2~\tfrac{m}{s}}$, plot the velocity graph for this motion.  (Yep, this is a bit tricky... go for it! Break the graph into useful parts.)

Describe the motion of the object in words, based on the velocity graph that you drew.\vfill
