{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} For each of the following motions, draw a position graph and a velocity graph (with accurate numbers on the axes). Define up/right positive, down/left negative. As always, state any assumptions that you make.\bigskip

A car starts from rest, steadily speeds up to ${30~\tfrac{m}{s}}$ in 15 seconds, moves at a constant speed for 30 seconds, then comes to a halt in 5 seconds.

A rock is dropped from a bridge and steadily speeds up as it falls. It is moving at ${30~\tfrac{m}{s}}$ three seconds later, when it hits the ground.
