{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} Dori's running at ${2~\tfrac{m}{s}}$ towards Tower Hill's goal line from 20 meters away when Danica lofts a ball over Dori's head.  The ball hits the ground 3 meters ahead of Dori and rolls towards the goal line at ${4~\tfrac{m}{s}}$.  

\bigskip

It takes 1.5 seconds for Dori to react to the ball; at that point, she begins running faster in order to catch up with the ball before it reaches the goal line.

\bigskip

How fast does she need to run to catch up with the ball before it goes over the goal line? Use algebraic problem-solving.
