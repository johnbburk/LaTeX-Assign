{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} The edge of a pool lies 8.0 m (about 26 feet) from the base of a hotel building. The flat roof of the hotel is 25.0 m above the pool (about 82 feet or 5 stories). 

\bigskip
Can an average person run off the roof fast enough to clear the edge of the pool? What would that impact be like?
