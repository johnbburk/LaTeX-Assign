They begin next to each other, start their pedaling at the same time and ride in opposite directions, trying to see who can ride the furthest before the rope snaps tight. If Creed can pedal his bike at 4 meters per second, and he ends up 5.1 meters away from the starting point, how fast did Kevin pedal?  Solve it graphically!

{\large Tips about this packet:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt 
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\rightarrow$}
\item These problems are designed as review for the term final. As we go through the term, you will be able to solve more and more of them.  Look at how much physics you're going to know! 
\item It's a great exercise to go through the packet periodically and identify places where models that you know apply and to identify specific situations that the models that you know don't apply.
\item Everyone should do every problem!
\item Put your work on the left-hand page. Use the right-right page for notes during presentations
\item Each person will present one problem to the class (approximately 10 minutes) near the end of the term
\item Choosing a problem that looks hard/scary/unfamiliar can allow you to become an expert in that, turning a weakness into a strength
\item The presentations will not be graded, but will be really helpful in preparing for the exam
\item Checking your solutions/answers with me before presentation day is a great idea (you'll only get 10 minutes to present in class, no matter what!)
\item There's no guarantee offered that this covers every piece of every standard from the term, but it's a great place to practice for the exam.

{\bf \Large{50.}} ${\left ( G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11}~\tfrac{Nm^2}{kg^2} \right )}$ A satellite is said to be in \emph{geosynchronous orbit} if it always stays above the same spot on the body that it is orbiting.  It accomplishes this by having the same orbital period as the rotational period of the body that is it orbiting. (How long is that for the Earth?)

\bigskip

a. Determine how far from the surface of the Earth a satellite must be placed in order to be in a geosynchronous orbit. ${\left ( R_{\Earth} = 6,370~km; M_{\Earth}=5.97 \times 10^{24}~kg \right )}$

\bigskip 
b. The space shuttle orbits the Earth with a period of around 90 minutes.  Is it closer to the Earth or further from the Earth than geosynchronous satellites?  Be convincing!

{\bf \Large{500.}} A car 3.5 m in length and traveling at a constant speed of ${20~\tfrac{m}{s}}$ is approaching an intersection. The width of the intersection is 20 m. The light turns yellow when the front of the car is 50 m from the beginning of the intersection. If the driver steps on the brake, the car will slow at a rate of ${4.2~\tfrac{m}{s}}$ per second. If the driver instead steps on the gas pedal, the car will accelerate at ${1.5~\tfrac{m}{s^2}}$. The light will be yellow for 3 seconds. Ignore the reaction time of the driver. 

\bigskip
To avoid being in the intersection while the light is red, should the driver hit the brake pedal or the gas pedal? Justify your answer with some pretty physics.

{\bf \Large{710.}} A bullet of mass $25~g$ is fired along an incline and imbeds itself quickly into a block of wood of mass $2.5~kg$. The block and bullet then slide up the frictionless $20^{\circ}$ incline, traveling a maximum distance of 3.5 meters up the incline. The block is kept from sliding down the incline initially by as small peg (not shown).

\bigskip
Determine the speed of the bullet just before it hits the wood.\paragraph{}
\noindent
\bigskip 
Suppose instead that the incline is not frictionless, and that there is a coefficient of kinetic friction between the incline and the block of .2.  Determine how far the block travels up the ramp in this situation.

The coefficient of kinetic friction between the crate and floor is .5, and the coefficient of static friction between the crate and the floor is .85.

{\bf \Large{770.}} A 30 g bullet is shot into a 2.5 kg block of wood that is hanging from an 80 cm long rope. The bullet embeds itself in the wood, and the wood's suqsequent motion causes the rope to reach a maximum angle of 46 degrees from the vertical.\bigskip

Determine the initial speed of the bullet. \paragraph{}
\noindent
\bigskip 
As the block swings back towards its initial position, consider the moment when the rope is inclined 15 degrees from the vertical.  

\bigskip
What is the speed of the block at this moment? Compare the total energy of the bullet/block/Earth system at this moment and at the moment just before the bullet struck the block.  Explain the reason for the difference.
\bigskip 
Use the directions of the forces acting on the block at this moment and the direction of its motion to make an energy-based argument about why the block speeds up more quickly at this moment than it will when it is closer to its starting point.
