{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} Driving a car in the positive x direction at a speed of 60 mph, Mary tests her brakes by coming to a complete stop in 4 seconds. Then she accelerates to her original speed of 60 mph in 8 seconds. A motion diagram is created by illuminating her car with a strobe at 2 second intervals.
