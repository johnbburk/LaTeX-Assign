{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} A cannon shoots 9 kg cannonballs off of a 22 meter tall cliff.  The cannon is inclined 17 degrees above the horizontal.  The initial velocity of the cannonballs is ${190~\tfrac{m}{s}}$.

\bigskip
Determine, in two different ways, the speed of the cannonballs when they hit the cliff floor.\paragraph{}

Determine the launch angle that would make the cannonball have the largest possible horizontal range during its flight. You'll have to get creative to solve this equation!
