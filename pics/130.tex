{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} Gaeta's Raptor is drifting away from Galactica at a speed of 200 meters per second, while the Galactica drifts away from the Raptor at a speed of 75 meters per second.  The two ships are initially 300 km away from each other.

\bigskip

\indent  How much time will pass before they are 600 km away from each other, and communication is lost?
