{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} A 50 kg peewee football player runs into a stationary 40 kg player at an initial speed of 4 meters per second. The magnitude of the force exerted by the football players on each other is shown as a function of time. 

\bigskip
Draw quantitatively accurate acceleration graphs for each player.
\paragraph{}
\noindent
\vfill
Use your acceleration graphs to determine the players' final velocities.
\vfill

Draw a motion diagram showing the players' motions before and after the collision.
