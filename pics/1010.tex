{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} An object starts from rest at $x=0$ at time $t=0$. Five seconds later, the object is at $x=40~m$ and is velocity is ${+11~\tfrac{m}{s}}$. \bigskip

Was the object's acceleration constant or non-constant during this interval? Explain/give evidence to support your reasoning.

Sketch the velocity graph implied by these data. Is the graph linear or curved? If it is curved, is it concave up or down?
