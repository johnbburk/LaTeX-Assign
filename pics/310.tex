{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}}An exciting chase has broken out between a toy police car and a toy speeder (running from the police because he foolishly doesn’t have any toy insurance).   \begin{center}

\bigskip
Describe the segment of the chase shown so far, as accurately as you can (ie: including exact values).
 
\vspace{40mm}
Assuming that the toy police car can get up to speed very quickly, how fast will it need to go in order to catch the speeder before ${t=~}$20 s?
