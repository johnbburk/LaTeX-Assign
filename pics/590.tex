{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} A glider is given a quick push to start it moving up a ${7^{\circ}}$ inlined air track. The glider travels to a maximum distance of 112 cm up the track.

\bigskipDetermine the initial speed of the glider. 
\vfill
\vfill
Draw a velocity graph for the glider; use the graph to determine how long the glider takes to get to that 112 cm point.
\vfill

Use your velocity graph to determine where the glider will be 2 seconds after it was launched.
