{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} A truck drives down a dark highway, driving ${34~\tfrac{m}{s}}$.  A deer steps into the road 30 meters ahead of the car.  The driver has a .3 second reaction time, after which he slams on the brakes.  The brakes have the ability to stop the car within 1.8 seconds when traveling at this speed.  \bigskipWill he stop before hitting the deer?  \paragraph{}
