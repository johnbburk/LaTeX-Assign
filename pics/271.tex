{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} Instead of waiting for a soccer pass to come to you, moving towards the ball can greatly increase your chances of not having the ball stolen.  A pass is made to you from 25 meters away, with a speed of ${13~\tfrac{m}{s}}$.  After a .4 second pause (your reaction time), you begin running towards the ball at ${5~\tfrac{m}{s}}$.

\bigskip
What issues might make a CVPM model of this situation less than faithful to the real situation?\vspace{30mm}Where (at what position) will you receive the pass? Use graphical problem-solving.
