{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} A running back carries the football down the field, running ${5.6~\tfrac{m}{s}}$.  The slower safety (running speed: ${4.5~\tfrac{m}{s}}$) runs towards him and tries to tackle him. They begin 22 meters apart and run straight at each other.  %\begin{center} \includegraphics[scale=1]{/Users/jgates/desktop/latex/pics/mongooses.png}

\bigskip

How far did the running back go before being tackled, and how much time elapsed before he was tackled? Use graphical problem solving.
