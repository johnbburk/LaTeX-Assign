{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} Jax is sitting by the side of the road on his motorcycle when Clay zips by at 30 meters per second.  Jax immediately takes off in pursuit, driving with a constant acceleration.  Jax accelerates to Clay's speed within 15 seconds. \bigskip

How long will it take Jax to catch Clay?  Use algebraic methods. \paragraph{}
