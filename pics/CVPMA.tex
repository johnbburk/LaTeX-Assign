{\bf \Large{130.}} Gaeta's Raptor is drifting away from Galactica at a speed of 200 meters per second, while the Galactica drifts away from the Raptor at a speed of 75 meters per second.  The two ships are initially 300 km away from each other.

{\bf \Large{160.}} As its crew sleeps, the Nostromo glides through space at a brisk clip of ${920~\tfrac{km}{s}}$, relative to a nearby asteroid that it is approaching.  The computer uses radar (object detection using radio waves, which travel at the speed of light: ${3 \times 10^8 ~\tfrac{m}{s}}$) to detect objects in the ship's path.  The radio waves are emitted by the ship, bounce off of the asteroid, and return to the ship, where the computer analyzes the results.

\bigskip
Assume that the asteroid begins at the limit of the ship's effective radar range of 2 million km.  Once it detects the asteroid, the computer will require 15 minutes to revive the crew.  

\bigskip

How much time will the crew have to turn the ship at that point?

{\bf \Large{180.}} A fast RC car (speed: ${12~\tfrac{m}{s}}$ and a slower RC car (${8~\tfrac{m}{s}}$) are 40 meters apart. They then drive directly towards each other.  Some time after the cars have passed each other, the faster car is 15 meters away from the slower one.

It takes 1.5 seconds for Dori to react to the ball; at that point, she begins running faster in order to catch up with the ball before it reaches the goal line.

{\bf \Large{500.}} A car 3.5 m in length and traveling at a constant speed of ${20~\tfrac{m}{s}}$ is approaching an intersection. The width of the intersection is 20 m. The light turns yellow when the front of the car is 50 m from the beginning of the intersection. If the driver steps on the brake, the car will slow at a rate of ${4.2~\tfrac{m}{s}}$ per second. If the driver instead steps on the gas pedal, the car will accelerate at ${1.5~\tfrac{m}{s^2}}$. The light will be yellow for 3 seconds. Ignore the reaction time of the driver. 

\bigskip
To avoid being in the intersection while the light is red, should the driver hit the brake pedal or the gas pedal? Justify your answer with some pretty physics.

The outlaw plans to have the wagon roll down the slope and across the level ground, and then fall into a canyon where his confederates wait.

Find the speed of the wagon when it reaches the flat ground. Note that it starts from rest at the top of the incline and that the wagon rolls with negligible friction.
