{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} A car starting from rest speeds up to ${30~\frac{m}{s}}$ with constant acceleration in 15 seconds. Then, it travels at ${30~\frac{m}{s}}$ for 10 seconds. Finally, it brakes to a stop in 30 seconds with constant acceleration. 

 \bigskip

\indent How far does it travel in the 55 second time period?
