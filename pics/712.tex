{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} A bullet of mass $25~g$ is fired along an incline and imbeds itself quickly into a block of wood of mass $2.5~kg$. The block and bullet then slide up the frictionless $20^{\circ}$ incline, traveling a maximum distance of 3.5 meters up the incline. The block is kept from sliding down the incline initially by as small peg (not shown).

\bigskip
Determine the speed of the bullet just before it hits the wood.\paragraph{}
\noindent
\vfill

Suppose instead that the bullet passes through the block, emerging at a speed of ${165~\tfrac{m}{s}}$.  How far would the block slide up the incline now?
