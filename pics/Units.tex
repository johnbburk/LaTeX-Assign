{\bf \Large{130.}} Gaeta's Raptor is drifting away from Galactica at a speed of 200 meters per second, while the Galactica drifts away from the Raptor at a speed of 75 meters per second.  The two ships are initially 300 km away from each other.

\bigskip

\indent  How much time will pass before they are 600 km away from each other, and communication is lost?

{\bf \Large{150.}} Creed and Kevin find some bikes by the loading dock, and devise a competition: they use an 8 meter long rope to tie their bikes together and set up next to each other, facing opposite directions.  They begin next to each other, start their pedaling at the same time and ride in opposite directions, trying to see who can ride the furthest before the rope snaps tight. If Creed can pedal his bike at 4 meters per second, and he ends up 5.1 meters away from the starting point, how fast did Kevin pedal?  Solve it graphically!  Assume that they can get up to speed instantly.

{\bf \Large{160.}} As its crew sleeps, the Nostromo glides through space at a brisk clip of ${920~\tfrac{km}{s}}$, relative to a nearby asteroid that it is approaching.  The computer uses radar (object detection using radio waves, which travel at the speed of light: ${3 \times 10^8 ~\tfrac{m}{s}}$) to detect objects in the ship's path.  The radio waves are emitted by the ship, bounce off of the asteroid, and return to the ship, where the computer analyzes the results.

\bigskip
Assume that the asteroid begins at the limit of the ship's effective radar range of 2 million km.  Once it detects the asteroid, the computer will require 15 minutes to revive the crew.  

\bigskip

How much time will the crew have to turn the ship at that point?

{\bf \Large{180.}} A fast RC car (speed: ${12~\tfrac{m}{s}}$ and a slower RC car (${8~\tfrac{m}{s}}$) are 40 meters apart. They then drive directly towards each other.  Some time after the cars have passed each other, the faster car is 15 meters away from the slower one.  

\bigskip
At this moment, how far has the slower one traveled from its starting position?

\bigskip

It takes 1.5 seconds for Dori to react to the ball; at that point, she begins running faster in order to catch up with the ball before it reaches the goal line.
