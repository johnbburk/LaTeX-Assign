{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}} An Atwood machine is constructed from a 3 kg mass and a 1 kg mass.  The 3 kg mass is released from rest 180 cm off of the floor, while the 1 kg mass is 40 cm above the floor.

\bigskip
Determine the speed of the 3 kg mass as it hits the floor.
\paragraph{}
\noindent
\vfill

After the 3 kg mass hits the floor, the 1 kg mass will continue to move upwards for a short time.  Determine how high above the floor the 1 kg mass will rise.
\vfill

Draw quantitatively correct acceleration and velocity graphs for the 1 kg mass.
