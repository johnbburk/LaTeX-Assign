{\bf \Large{\arabic{ProbNum}}}A real police car chases down a stolen sturgeon truck.  The police car is sitting by the side of the road when the truck flies by at ${35~\tfrac{m}{s}}$.  Assume that the police officer reacts after the truck is 150 meters past her and gets up to speed instantly.   %\begin{center}

How fast does she need to go in order to catch the truck within 2 minutes? Use graphical problem-solving.
